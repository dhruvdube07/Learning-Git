üíª Code Details
The core functionality is handled by a small JavaScript snippet that listens for a form submission. Instead of reloading the page, it displays a success message. This is a common pattern for modern web applications that handle data without a full page refresh.

üî® Customization
You can easily modify the design by changing the Tailwind CSS utility classes in the index.html file. For example, to change the main color from blue to purple, you can replace bg-sky-600 with bg-purple-600 on the login button.

ü§ù Contribution
